Presentation Topic: Developing an Audit Program for Reviewing Hire Purchase Loans for Repossessed Vehicles
🧭 Objective of the Audit Program:
This audit focuses on identifying risks in cases where vehicles that were previously repossessed or auctioned by the bank are resubmitted for financing.
The program aims to evaluate whether internal controls are adequate by reviewing:
 - Data accuracy
 - Fair valuation
 - Adherence to loan approval processes

🔍 Structure of the Audit Program
🧱 1. Objective
To assess the adequacy of the loan approval process for hire purchase financing involving previously repossessed or auctioned vehicles, focusing on:
 - Accuracy of information
 - Reasonableness of valuation
 - Compliance with lending policy

📦 2. Scope
 - Hire purchase loans from the past 12 months
 - Vehicles previously repossessed or auctioned and then re-financed
 - Involvement of dealers and loan officers
 - Related systems: DMS, Core Leasing, BI Reports

🧪 3. Key Audit Procedures
Step	Topic	                                            Purpose
1	    Retrieve repossessed vehicle data	                Extract data for comparison
2	    Compare with new loan records	                    Identify VINs reused in new loan applications
3	    Analyze related dealers	                          Identify high-risk dealers linked to resubmissions
4	    Verify LTV accuracy	                              Compare loan amount vs vehicle valuation (flag LTV > 90%)
5	    Review loan documents	                            Examine overrides and exception handling
6	    Analyze trends	                                  Review repossession-to-loan resubmission rate
7	    Review internal controls	                        Check for system flags or alerts on reused VINs
8–10	Summarize, Report, and Prepare Working Papers	    Consolidate findings, assign follow-ups, and compile documentation

📊 4. Risk Analysis
🔸 Systemic Risks
 - No system flag for reused VINs → may lead to duplicate loans
 - DMS and Core Leasing systems not integrated → incomplete oversight

🔸 Process & Human Risks
 - Dealers or staff may intentionally resubmit risky vehicles
 - Overrides without supporting documentation undermine internal controls

🔸 Regulatory & Compliance Risks
 - Misalignment with Hire Purchase Act B.E. 2565 and BOT guidance
 - Lack of structured follow-up on audit issues → recurring findings

📘 5. Reference Standards
 - Hire Purchase Act B.E. 2565
 - Bank of Thailand (BOT) Lending Guidance
 - IIA IPPF Standards 2024
 - ISO/IEC 27001 – Customer data protection and access controls

✅ Benefits of This Audit Program
 - Prevents repeated financing of high-risk repossessed assets
 - Establishes auditable, risk-based internal control checkpoints
 - Provides a foundation for behavioral and fraud analytics (dealers/staff)
 - Aligns with risk-based audit methodologies and regulatory standards
